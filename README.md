# SDSS-V_Commissioning
My Analysis of SDSS-V Commissioning Data.

In this analysis, I compare 4 different versions of the APOGEE data. I start with DR12, since that is what was used with Nidever et al. (2015), see doc directory. I then look at DR17, since that is the most up-to-date SDSS-4 data. Then I look at the SDSS-V plate program and the SDSS-V commissioning data. My goal is to get a sense of the overall quality of RVs, but also with a special focus on cooler stars.

To Do List:
- Figure out why the ngoodvisits are different than the number of good lines in allVisit file
- Take a closer look at what is going on with exposure times in SDSS-V data
- Try to understand exactly what is happening with Hmag vs. Median Visit SN
- Drill down into giants, subgiants and dwarfs specifically.
